```
A quiz that allows someone to find out which animal (cat, dog, fox, hamster, horse) they are most similar to by answering 5 multiple choice questions and be able to share result. Generate an image for each animal in a cute cartoon vector style and display it on the result page. Allow the user to retake the quiz as many times as they want. Write the questions and answers yourself. Randomize the order of the answers for each question.

Place the quiz on the home page.

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

The following files in your repository will need to be edited or added to implement the quiz, generate the animal images, and update the app logo and metadata:

1. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – to import and render the new quiz component on the home page.  
2. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to change the app title and description.  
3. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to generate the new app logo.  
4. `mini-app/public/cat.png.todo` – to generate the cat image.  
5. `mini-app/public/dog.png.todo` – to generate the dog image.  
6. `mini-app/public/fox.png.todo` – to generate the fox image.  
7. `mini-app/public/hamster.png.todo` – to generate the hamster image.  
8. `mini-app/public/horse.png.todo` – to generate the horse image.  
9. `mini-app/components/quiz.tsx` – a new component that implements the quiz logic and UI.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for each.

A stylized, colorful logo featuring a playful cartoon animal mascot that represents the app. The mascot is a friendly, smiling creature with a bright, eye-catching color palette. The background is a simple, solid color that complements the mascot’s colors. The logo should convey a sense of fun and curiosity, inviting users to explore the animal quiz. The mascot’s design is cute and approachable, with exaggerated features such as large eyes and a small nose, and it should be easily recognizable as a whimsical animal character. The overall composition is balanced and centered, making it suitable for use as a website favicon and header logo.
